        "*   A conceptual approach for integrating AI for traffic obfuscation was outlined, suggesting the use of AI models to analyze network traffic features (like protocol, obfuscation, latency, HTTP status, and success) to modify or generate traffic that appears legitimate, although practical implementation was not feasible.\n",

        "*   A comprehensive plan for testing and evaluating the VPN was developed, including defining Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as connection success rate, latency, throughput, and blocked content accessibility.\n",
        "*   The testing methodology involves simulated censorship scenarios (IP blocking, DNS filtering, Deep Packet Inspection) and potential real-world testing with ethical considerations.\n",
        "*   The plan for data analysis involves comparing performance with and without the VPN, analyzing metrics across scenarios, and using statistical methods to identify weaknesses and areas for improvement.\n",
